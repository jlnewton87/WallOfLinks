# WallOfLinks
That just about sums it up.  Just a wall of links to replace the old Sharepoint install that we had at work, and needed to get rid of since it was running on Windows Server 2008 or so.

##Tech
Used this as an opportunity to flex my MEAN muscles.  

  Built using Node.js + Express (handlebars as view engine) + Knockout (OK, not quite Angular, but still awesome) + MongoDB

  Pretty basic, since I only had a couple of days to work on it
  
  
##Use It Now
Easy to setup. Just start Mongo, change connection string in /Model/panel.js and start `node ./bin/www`
